# RPGWeb


## So here's the idea
I'm horrible at finishing projects, that's obvious if you've gone through my github page. However one thing rings true, I do enjoy making frameworks for roleplaying games. It's basically my default way of learning new languages etc..
So the idea is this, I've made several attempts at a framework for roleplaying games with the thought that they have to be shown in a text-based context. However, why not just make it a webapp?

## The project
Shadcn has a really nice library of components. I'm not focusing on building a frontend in this project, just implementing an RPG framework into the backend to be pulled by the frontend built with React + Shadcn.

## The stack (So far)
Some React based framework (TBD, who cares.)
Litestar backend w/ RPG framework built in python
Who knows what else will come, join in! Let's make something fun.
